# Fall 2022 CSC 211 with Prof. Aydin Team Project 

## The Theme

  The purpose of our project will be to create a site that showcases the invetory of the assorted cars that we supply, and the quantity of each specific car, including a feature of a hyperlink and a scroll function for the simplicity of the user.

## Feature List

  There is going to be a button when the application is first launched.  From there, you are able to click the button to show the current list of cars and how many of them are currently in stock.

### Issues and future work

  A couple of obvious issues could be seen in the program.  First, the scroll bar doesnt work with the inventory as intended.  You are supposed to be able to scroll up and down through the inventory.  Second, the hyperlink is supposed to bring you to a picture of the best selling car (Audi R8 2023).  Some plans for the future that we have is trying to get the scroll bar and hyperlink to work as intended.  It is probably not working because there is no established relationship between the two.  As for the hyperlink, the link was probably not entered into the right field.  In the future, we would like to add a variety of features and more types of vehicles.
